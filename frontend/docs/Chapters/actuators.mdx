# Actuators & Motors

This chapter covers actuators and motors used in humanoid robotics - the components that provide the power and control for robot movement.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify different types of actuators used in humanoid robots
- Understand the characteristics and applications of each actuator type
- Analyze the control requirements for different actuators
- Design actuator systems for specific humanoid robot applications

## Concepts
Actuators are the components of a robot that make it move. They convert energy (usually electrical) into mechanical motion. In humanoid robots, actuators must provide precise control while being compact enough to fit within human-like form factors.

Common actuator types in humanoid robotics include servo motors, stepper motors, hydraulic actuators, and pneumatic actuators. Each type has specific advantages and limitations depending on the application.

## Examples
1. **Servo Motors in Joint Control**: High-precision motors used for controlling arm and leg joints
2. **Hydraulic Actuators**: Used in large humanoid robots like Atlas for high-power applications
3. **Series Elastic Actuators**: Provide compliant control important for safe human-robot interaction

## Code/Pseudocode
```
// Pseudocode for actuator control
function controlActuator(actuatorId, targetPosition, maxTorque):
    currentPosition = readPosition(actuatorId)
    positionError = targetPosition - currentPosition
    controlSignal = PIDController.calculate(positionError)
    applyTorque(actuatorId, controlSignal, maxTorque)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
Compare the advantages and disadvantages of using servo motors versus hydraulic actuators in humanoid robots.

### Exercise 2
Explain the importance of backdrivability in humanoid robot actuators.

### Exercise 3
Describe how series elastic actuators improve safety in humanoid robots.

## Summary
Actuators and motors form the foundation of humanoid robot movement. Selecting the right actuator type and implementing proper control strategies is crucial for achieving desired robot behaviors.
