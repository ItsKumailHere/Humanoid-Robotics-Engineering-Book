# Simulation

This chapter covers simulation in humanoid robotics - the use of computer models to simulate humanoid robot behavior and environments for development and testing.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the importance of simulation in humanoid robot development
- Apply physics-based simulation techniques to humanoid robotics
- Analyze the differences between simulation and real-world robot behavior
- Implement simulation-to-reality transfer techniques

## Concepts
Simulation plays a crucial role in humanoid robotics development, allowing developers to test algorithms, control systems, and behaviors in a safe, repeatable, and cost-effective environment. Physics-based simulators model the dynamics of both the robot and its environment.

Key simulation platforms for humanoid robotics include Gazebo, Webots, MuJoCo, and PyBullet. Simulators must accurately model complex physics including friction, collisions, and contact forces that are critical for humanoid robot behavior.

## Examples
1. **Controller Development**: Testing control algorithms before hardware deployment
2. **Motion Planning**: Planning complex movements in virtual environments
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Training robot behaviors in simulation before real-world deployment

## Code/Pseudocode
```
// Pseudocode for physics simulation loop
function simulatePhysics(robotModel, environment, deltaTime):
    while simulationRunning:
        robotForces = computeRobotForces(robotModel)
        environmentForces = computeEnvironmentForces()
        combinedForces = robotForces + environmentForces
        robotModel.updateState(combinedForces, deltaTime)
        detectCollisions(robotModel, environment)
        handleCollisions()
        updateSensors(robotModel)
        renderScene(robotModel, environment)
        sleep(deltaTime)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
Explain the concept of the "reality gap" in robotics simulation.

### Exercise 2
Compare the advantages and disadvantages of different physics simulation engines.

### Exercise 3
Describe how simulation can be used to train humanoid robot behaviors.

## Summary
Simulation is an essential tool in humanoid robotics development, enabling safe testing and algorithm development. However, bridging the gap between simulation and reality remains an ongoing challenge.
