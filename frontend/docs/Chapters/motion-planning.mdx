# Motion Planning

This chapter covers motion planning in humanoid robotics - algorithms and methods for planning robot movements in complex environments.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand fundamental motion planning algorithms
- Apply path planning techniques to humanoid robot navigation
- Analyze the complexity of planning for high-DOF systems
- Implement planning algorithms for specific humanoid tasks

## Concepts
Motion planning for humanoid robots involves finding collision-free paths from a start configuration to a goal configuration. The complexity is significantly higher than for simple mobile robots due to the high number of degrees of freedom and the need to maintain balance.

Key approaches include sampling-based methods (like RRT), grid-based methods, and optimization-based approaches. For humanoid robots, planning often needs to consider balance constraints, multi-contact planning, and dynamic movements.

## Examples
1. **Navigation**: Planning paths through environments with obstacles
2. **Whole-Body Motion**: Planning coordinated motion for all limbs while maintaining balance
3. **Grasping**: Planning approach paths for manipulation tasks

## Code/Pseudocode
```
// Pseudocode for RRT motion planning
function RRT(start, goal, environment, iterations):
    tree = [start]
    for i = 0 to iterations:
        randomPoint = sampleRandomConfiguration()
        nearest = findNearest(tree, randomPoint)
        newPoint = extend(nearest, randomPoint)
        if isValid(newPoint, environment):
            tree.append(newPoint)
            if distance(newPoint, goal) < threshold:
                return getPathToGoal(tree, goal)
    return failure
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
Explain why motion planning for humanoid robots is more complex than for wheeled robots.

### Exercise 2
Compare sampling-based and grid-based motion planning approaches for humanoid robots.

### Exercise 3
Describe the challenges of planning whole-body motion for humanoid robots.

## Summary
Motion planning is critical for humanoid robot autonomy. The high degrees of freedom and balance requirements make planning particularly challenging but essential for practical humanoid robot applications.
