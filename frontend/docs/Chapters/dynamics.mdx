# Dynamics

This chapter covers dynamics in humanoid robotics - the study of forces and torques that cause motion.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the principles of robotic dynamics
- Apply Newton-Euler and Lagrangian formulations
- Analyze forces acting on humanoid robot joints
- Design control systems considering dynamic effects

## Concepts
Robot dynamics deals with the relationship between forces acting on a robot mechanism and the resulting motion. For humanoid robots, dynamics is crucial for stable walking, manipulation, and interaction with the environment.

The dynamic equations of motion for a robot include terms for inertial forces, Coriolis and centrifugal forces, and gravitational forces. These equations are fundamental for controller design and simulation.

## Examples
1. **Walking Stability**: Calculating forces needed to maintain balance during bipedal locomotion
2. **Manipulation Tasks**: Understanding forces during object grasping and manipulation
3. **Impact Response**: Modeling how robots react when hitting objects or surfaces

## Code/Pseudocode
```
// Pseudocode for computing robot dynamics
function computeDynamics(jointPositions, jointVelocities, jointAccelerations, robotModel):
    M = computeInertiaMatrix(jointPositions, robotModel)  // Inertia matrix
    C = computeCoriolisForces(jointPositions, jointVelocities, robotModel)  // Coriolis matrix
    G = computeGravityForces(jointPositions, robotModel)  // Gravity vector
    tau = M * jointAccelerations + C * jointVelocities + G  // Required joint torques
    return tau
```
