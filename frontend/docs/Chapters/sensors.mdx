# Sensors

This chapter covers sensors used in humanoid robotics - the components that enable robots to perceive their environment and provide feedback about their state.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand different types of sensors used in humanoid robots
- Analyze the role of sensors in robot perception and control
- Design sensor systems for humanoid robot applications
- Implement sensor fusion for enhanced perception

## Concepts
Sensors in humanoid robots serve multiple purposes: providing perception of the environment, feedback for control systems, and safety monitoring. They can be categorized into proprioceptive sensors (measuring internal state) and exteroceptive sensors (measuring external environment).

Key sensor types include IMUs for orientation and acceleration, cameras for vision, force/torque sensors for interaction, and range sensors for environment mapping. Sensor fusion combines data from multiple sensors to improve perception accuracy.

## Examples
1. **Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)**: Used for balance and orientation in walking robots
2. **Force/Torque Sensors**: Located in feet and hands to measure interaction forces
3. **Cameras and LIDAR**: Enable environmental perception and navigation

## Code/Pseudocode
```
// Pseudocode for sensor fusion
function sensorFusion(cameraData, lidarData, imuData):
    worldState = estimateWorldState(cameraData, lidarData)
    robotState = estimateRobotState(imuData)
    fusedState = combineStates(worldState, robotState)
    return fusedState
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
Explain the difference between proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors in humanoid robots.

### Exercise 2
Describe how IMUs contribute to balance control in humanoid robots.

### Exercise 3
Compare the advantages and disadvantages of using cameras versus LIDAR for environment perception.

## Summary
Sensors are critical for humanoid robot perception and control. Proper selection and integration of sensors enable robots to safely interact with their environment and perform complex tasks.
