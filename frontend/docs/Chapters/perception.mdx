# Perception

This chapter covers perception in humanoid robotics - how humanoid robots understand and interpret their environment.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand sensor technologies used for humanoid robot perception
- Apply computer vision and pattern recognition techniques
- Implement sensor fusion for enhanced environment understanding
- Design perception systems for specific humanoid robot tasks

## Concepts
Perception in humanoid robots encompasses the ability to sense and interpret the environment using various sensors. This includes vision systems, auditory systems, and tactile sensing. Perception enables robots to navigate, recognize objects, identify humans, and understand their surroundings.

Key challenges in humanoid perception include real-time processing, uncertainty handling, and multimodal sensor integration. Perception systems must be robust to environmental variations and provide accurate information for robot decision-making.

## Examples
1. **SLAM**: Simultaneous localization and mapping for navigation
2. **Object Recognition**: Identifying and classifying objects in the environment
3. **Human Recognition**: Detecting and identifying humans for interaction

## Code/Pseudocode
```
// Pseudocode for object recognition
function recognizeObject(sensorData):
    features = extractFeatures(sensorData)
    classification = classifier.predict(features)
    confidence = classifier.confidence(features)
    if confidence > threshold:
        return classification
    else:
        return "unknown"
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
Explain the difference between top-down and bottom-up approaches to perception in robotics.

### Exercise 2
Describe the challenges of real-time perception in humanoid robots.

### Exercise 3
Compare LIDAR and camera-based approaches for environment perception.

## Summary
Perception is fundamental for humanoid robots to interact with their environment. Effective perception systems enable robots to perform complex tasks by understanding their surroundings and the objects within them.
