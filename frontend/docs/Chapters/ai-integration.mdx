# AI Integration

This chapter covers AI integration in humanoid robotics - the implementation of artificial intelligence techniques to enhance robotic capabilities and enable learning.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand different AI approaches applicable to humanoid robotics
- Apply machine learning techniques to humanoid robot behaviors
- Analyze the benefits and challenges of AI integration in robotics
- Implement AI systems for perception, control, and interaction

## Concepts
AI integration in humanoid robotics involves incorporating artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and planning to enhance robot capabilities. This allows robots to adapt to new situations, learn from experience, and interact more naturally with humans.

Key AI techniques in humanoid robotics include reinforcement learning for control and behavior, deep learning for perception tasks, and planning algorithms for complex task execution. AI integration enables more autonomous and adaptive robot behavior.

## Examples
1. **Reinforcement Learning**: Training walking gaits and manipulation skills
2. **Computer Vision**: Object recognition and scene understanding
3. **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and responding to human commands

## Code/Pseudocode
```
// Pseudocode for reinforcement learning in humanoid control
function trainPolicy(robotEnvironment, policyNetwork, episodes):
    for episode = 0 to episodes:
        state = robotEnvironment.reset()
        totalReward = 0
        for step in episode:
            action = policyNetwork.selectAction(state)
            nextState, reward, done = robotEnvironment.step(action)
            policyNetwork.update(state, action, reward, nextState)
            state = nextState
            totalReward += reward
            if done: break
    return policyNetwork
```
